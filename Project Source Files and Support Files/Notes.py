--- Rules of the Game (Boggle): ---

- Each session lasts 3 minutes
- Words can be constructed from the letters of sequentially adjascent cubes 
	where "adjascent cubes are those horizontally, vertically, and diagonally 
	neighboring.
- Words must be at least three letters long, may include singular and plural 
	(or other derived forms) separately, but may not use the same letter cube
	more than once per word.
- If two or more players wrote the same word, it is removed from all players' 
	lists.
- Any player may challenge the validity of a word, in which case the inbuilt
	dictionary is used to verify or refute it.
- Points are awarded based on the length of the word.
- The winner is the player whose point total is highest, with any ties 
	typically broken by count of long words.
